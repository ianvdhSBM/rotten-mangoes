## Rotten Mangoes

### Lighthouse Labs - Week 5 project

A great introduction to Rails.

I learned how to:

- How to use Rails generators to create **Controllers, Models and Mailers**

- Used **namespacing** to implement Admin::UserControllers, including Admin::User#create, #edit, #destroy

- Using a **singular** resource vs resources for routing (for user sessions on this project)

- Use **scopes** to chain searches
